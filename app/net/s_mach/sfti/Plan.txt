Final Project - May 15

Ideas:

Training Program Efficacy
*Workout plan suggester (algorithmic for BB vs. Powerlifters vs. Oly specifics)
*Progressive overload tracking (volume + weight)
*Diet tracker (macrolevel, waiting an MFP API request)
*D3 visualizations, working with scala.js?
*front end heavy
*reddit tie-in? profile history text analysis?

Featureset
1. Track
    a. Lifts from the day
    b. Weight
        i. Caloric change based on weight (+- 500 etc.)
        ii. Rate of change (safety)
        iii. BF Inference
    c. Daily caloric intake (pending MFP request)

2. Find suitable workout regimen
    a. Select Goal + Timeframe
    b. Select workouts/week
    c. Select experience level

3. Analyze (Front End .js heavy)
    a. Weightlifting
        i. Progressive Overload
        ii. Compound lift changes
        iii. Power Index
        iv. Failure: After x failed increases, suggest deload
    b. Weight Change
        i. Caloric change based on weight
        ii. Rate of change (safety)
        iii. BF Inference
    c. Mentality
        i. Completion of routines

4. Inspire (Galleria)
    a. Instagram feed of popular fitness leaders
        i. Arnold S.
        ii. Layne Norton
        iii. (sectioned by power, bb, oly)
    b. Feed of healthy foods
        i. Picture
        ii. Recipe
        iii. Macros
    c. Motivation
        i. Videos
        ii. Quotes
        iii. User stories

Backend
MongoDB vs. Postgres
